# Data Science Portfolio

Hello, welcome to my repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. These projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and have been completed using Python 3.6. If you would like to run any of these scripts, the datasets used are included within this portfolio as well.

I am always willing to meet new people in hopes of doing business together. I can be reached via email at drewrglov@gmail.com.

### Regression


##### Linear Regression
   • [App or Website?](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Regression/Linear%20Regression%20-%20App%20or%20Website.ipynb) - In this problem, we will train a linear regression model to give insights into if an ecommerce company should focus their efforts on their mobile app or their website.
   
   • [Google Stock Predictions](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Regression/Regression%20-%20Stock.ipynb) - In this project, we work in creating a regression model that attempts to predict Google's stock prices for up to 35 days in the future. Of course, this project is for learning purposes only, as there are too many unpredictable factors to take into account with the stock market.

   • [Building a Linear Regression Model from Scratch](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Regression/Linear%20regression%20from%20scratch.ipynb) - Here, we will build a linear regression model from scratch in order to better understand the theory behind it.

### Classification


##### Logistic Regression
   • [Logistic Regression for Promotion Targeting](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/Promotion%20Targeting.ipynb) - For this marketing problem project, we will be determining which customers have the highest probability of responding to a new promotion, and how many of these customers we should target for profit maximization.

   • [Logistic Regression for Targeted Advertisements](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/Logistic%20Regression%20for%20Targeted%20Advertisements.ipynb) - In this project we will be working with an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
  
##### K Nearest Neighbors
   • [K Nearest Neighbors Classification on Classified Data](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20with%20Classified%20Data.ipynb) - We've been given a classified data set from a company. They've hidden the feature column names but have given us the data and the target classes. We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features. We will use the elbow method to choose the best number for K.
   
   • [K Nearest Neighbors Classification on Classified Data 2](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20with%20Classified%20Data%202.ipynb) - A project similar to 'K Nearest Neighbors Classification on Classified Data', but with a different data set. This is to test the KNN method in multiple scenarios to examine its versatility. Again, we will use the elbow method to choose the best number for K.

   • [Predicting if a Breast Lump is Malignant or Benign with K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20-%20Breast%20Cancer.ipynb) - In this workbook, we will build a K Nearest Neighbors model in order to attempt to predict instances of breast cancer and whether a lump is benign or malignant based on certain characteristics of the lump.
   
   • [Building a K Nearest Neighbors Model from Scratch](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20from%20Scratch.ipynb) - In this notebook, we will build a K Nearest Neighbors model from scratch and visualize the results of the model in order to gain a deeper understanding of the theory behind K Nearest Neighbors.

Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
   
   • [Predicting Kyphosis with Decision Trees & Random Forests](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/Predicting%20Kyphosis%20with%20Decision%20Trees%20%26%20Random%20Forests.ipynb) - In this notebook, we will explore decision trees and random forests models, and use them to attempt to predict if a person will continue to suffer from Kyphosis after a corrective surgery based on a few characteristics of that person. This dataset is small, and the purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of decision trees and random forests.

##### Support Vector Machines
   • [Breast Cancer Predictions with SVM and Grid Search](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/%20Breast%20Cancer%20Predictions%20with%20SVM.ipynb) - In this workbook, we will build an SVM model in order to attempt to predict instances of breast cancer and whether a lump is benign or malignant based on certain characteristics of the lump. We will use GridSearchCV() to tune our model.
   
   • [Analyzing the Famous Iris Flower Dataset with an SVM](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20-%20Iris.ipynb) - For this project, we will be using the famous Iris flower data set, and attempting to use an SVM to correctly categorize these flowers.
   
   • [SVM Optimization from Scratch](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Classification/SVM%20optimization%20from%20scratch.ipynb) - Here, we will work on optimizing an SVM from scratch so that we have a deeper understanding of the theory behind SVMs.

It is **important to note**, we actually have the labels for this data set, but we will NOT use them for the KMeans clustering algorithm, since it is an unsupervised learning algorithm. We will use these labels for a classification report at the end of the project.
