# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. These projects have been completed using Python 3.6 unless otherwise specified. If you would like to run any of these scripts, the datasets used are included within this portfolio as well.

I am always willing to meet new people in hopes of doing business together. I can be reached via email at drewrglov@gmail.com.


## Contents

### Data Wrangling & Exploratory Analysis

##### Utilizing Pandas & Numpy

##### Principal Component Analysis

##### Image Processing
   • [Prepping Images for Nuclei Detection](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Prep%20with%20Images.ipynb) - This workbook demonstrates pre-processing images of nuclei so that they can be more easily detected via a nueral network. The images used are from Kaggle's 2018 Data Science Bowl. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018).


##### Data Parsing
   • [Parsing Delimited Values to Multiple Rows](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Parsing%20Data%20in%20Python.ipynb) - In this notebook, we explore a simple and quick solution to a common problem with datasets.

### Data Visualization


### Regression


##### Linear Regression
   • [App or Website?](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20-%20App%20or%20Website.ipynb) - In this problem, we will train a linear regression model to give insights into if an ecommerce company should focus their efforts on their mobile app or their website.
   
   • [Google Stock Predictions](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Regression%20-%20Stock.ipynb) - In this project, we work in creating a regression model that attempts to predict Google's stock prices for up to 35 days in the future. Of course, this project is for learning purposes only, as there are too many unpredictable factors to take into account with the stock market.

   • [Building a Linear Regression Model from Scratch](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Linear%20regression%20from%20scratch.ipynb) - Here, we will build a linear regression model from scratch in order to better understand the theory behind it.

### Classification


##### Logistic Regression
   • [Logistic Regression for Targeted Advertisements](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20for%20Targeted%20Advertisements.ipynb) - In this project we will be working with an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
  
##### K Nearest Neighbors
   • [Predicting if a Breast Lump is Malignant or Benign with K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20-%20Breast%20Cancer.ipynb) - In this workbook, we will build a K Nearest Neighbors model in order to attempt to predict instances of breast cancer and whether a lump is benign or malignant based on certain characteristics of the lump.
   
   • [Building a K Nearest Neighbors Model from Scratch](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20from%20Scratch.ipynb) - In this notebook, we will build a K Nearest Neighbors model from scratch and visualize the results of the model in order to gain a deeper understanding of the theory behind K Nearest Neighbors.

##### Decision Trees & Random Forests


##### Support Vector Machines
   • [Predicting if a Breast Lump is Malignant or Benign with SVMs](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/SVM%20-%20Breast%20Cancer.ipynb) - In this workbook, we will build an SVM model in order to attempt to predict instances of breast cancer and whether a lump is benign or malignant based on certain characteristics of the lump.
   
   • [SVM Optimization from Scratch](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/SVM%20optimization%20from%20scratch.ipynb) - Here, we will work on optimizing an SVM from scratch so that we have a deeper understanding of the theory behind SVMs.
   
### Clustering


##### K Means Clustering
   • [Visualizing K Means Clustering](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Visualizing%20K%20Means.ipynb) - We will create a simple visualization of K Means clustering to deepen our understanding of how it works.
   
   • [Can K Means Clustering Determine Titanic Survivors?](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Clustering%20-%20KMeans%20Titanic%20and%20Handling%20Text.ipynb) - For this project, we would like to use K Means clustering on the famous Titanic Passenger dataset to see if the K Means algorithm can give us any insight as to which factors led to a passenger's death or survival.

##### Mean Shift Clustering
   • [Can Mean Shift Clustering Determine Titanic Survivors?](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Mean%20Shift%20with%20Titanic%20Data.ipynb) - In this workbook, we will use mean shift clustering on the famaous Titanic dataset to see if it can provide us with any valuable insight as to which factors led to death or survival.
   
   • [Means Shift Visual](https://github.com/drewglov/Portfolio/blob/master/Hierarchical%20Clustering%20-%20Mean%20Shift.ipynb) - This is a simple 3d plot of a means shift clustering assignment to help provide a better understanding of means shift clustering.
