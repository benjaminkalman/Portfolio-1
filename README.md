# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. These projects have been completed using Python 3.6 unless otherwise specified.

I am always willing to meet new people in hopes of doing business together. I can be reached via email at drewrglov@gmail.com.
